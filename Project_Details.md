This project showcases the use of PostgreSQL triggers and event triggers to build a complete auditing mechanism. It captures all DML operations such as insert, update, delete, and truncate, along with the number of rows affected. In addition, it logs schema changes by recording the structure before and after alter operations in JSONB format for easy comparison. The solution combines AFTER triggers with event triggers to automate both data and schema change tracking. This provides a reliable way to maintain history, ensure compliance, and monitor database activity without external tools.
